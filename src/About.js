        <div>I hope to graduate UW this spring with a job and all my sanity with little stress.</div>
        <div>I also love food. Very much so.</div>
        <div>Just give me a good tv show or movie with some yum grub and I am set.</div>
        <div>This is what Sparkle looked like as a puppy, this photo isn't of her but it's got the same floppy ear.
